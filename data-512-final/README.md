# data512-final

The goal of my final project is to dive deeper into analyzing fake news on social media. For this analysis, I will be using FakeNewsNet - a data repository with news content, social context, and spatiotemporal information for studying fake news on social media. The repository can be found at https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet and the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01286.
