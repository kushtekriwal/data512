# data512-final


For my final project, I want to dig deeper into fake news. This is a topic that has gained a lot of traction recently and I would like to explore what constitutes fake news as well as the dissemination in social media. From a human centered perspective, fake news has dire consequences. With the growing dependence on smartphones, more individiauls read their news on social media and, hence, viral fake news can influence people wrongly. Through this analysis, I hope to learn the characteristics or features that identify news as fake as well as discover the websites that are guilty of sharing fake news.
